    <p>90 minutes of running, chasing, hitting and being hit, the life of a footballer or even a football fan doesn’t stop even after the full-time whistle. While the viewership ends after the referee’s whistle but there is an entire regime that goes behind such amazing performance.</p>
<p>Football is considered the world's greatest sport and "the beautiful game".

    There is no set universal explanation of exactly why football is referred to as the beautiful game, but it is widely accepted that the sport is so beloved for its sheer unpredictability, ability to bring communities together through fanhood and how visually pleasing an excellent game of football can be.</p>
